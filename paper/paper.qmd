abstract: "This analysis examines the impact of marriage on peopleâ€™s financial and social well-being, using data from Toronto. The study uses marriage records and demographic surveys from official Toronto sources to explore how marriage affects factors like income, employment, and divorce rates. The data is analyzed with a regression model to find patterns. The findings show that getting married often leads to higher income and better job stability for individuals. Additionally, marriages that happen later in life are less likely to end in divorce. These insights help highlight how marriage can play a role in improving financial stability and could be useful for family planning and public policies in Toronto."

# Introduction

You can and should cross-reference sections and sub-sections. We use @citeR and @rohan.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. @sec-data....



# Results

Our results are summarized in @tbl-modelresults.

```{r}
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = year, y = marriage_licenses)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + labs(title = "Number of Marriage per Year from 2011 to 2024",x = "Year", y = "Number of Marriage")

## Posterior predictive check

In @fig-ppcheckandposteriorvsprior-1 we implement a posterior predictive check. This shows...

In @fig-ppcheckandposteriorvsprior-2 we compare the posterior with the prior. This shows...
